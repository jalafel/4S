      Hi everyone, my name is Jess. I'm an undergraduate in CS at McGill University under the supervision of Elizabeth Patitsas. This is my first conference talk. Today I will be talking about Code and Software within our society, using Donna Haraway's articulation of the informatics of domination.

    <h2>Land Acknowledgement</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
      I wanted to begin my presentation with a land acknowledgement. As a settler in North America, in Canada in particular, I realized with the more research I did, how little I understood about the United States and Lousiana's relationship with Indigenious territories.

      Nevertheless, I do want to take the time to acknowledge the original custodians of the land and waters we call New Orleans were not European, but the Indigenous people of many tribes, Chitimacha, Atakapa, Caddo, Choctaw, Houma, Natchez, and Tunica; only one of which, Chitimacha is recognized ferdally.

      All the tribes met here on this land and called it Bulbancha, or "the place of many tongues".

      I call attention to this with mind that land acknowledgments often raise concerns about being nominal, and do not necessarily indicate a deep commitment to restoration of indigenous stewardship over the land. However, I hope that by doing so, to bridge the past and the present, in order for us all to become a greater agent of the future.

      <h2>Queering: A Verb</h2>
      <aside class="notes">
        I assume most of you in the audience have encountered or recognize queering as a tool in your own research or reading. But since I'm the first panelist of today, I just want to contextualize what I mean I when I use this word: which is a tool to interrogate binaries.

    <section>
      <h5>Sexuality:</h5>
      <p class="fragment">homosexuality/heterosexuality</p>
      <aside class="notes">
        In particular, binaries that set up a hegemonic perspective to one that has been marginalized.

        For example, at its origin, queerness was conceptualized to expand upon and make to be less stigmatized the term, homosexual.

      <h5>And Science ...?</h5>

      <p class="fragment">white/non-white</p>

      <aside class="notes">
        But this perspective and tooling can be re-purposed to more than just sexuality. Much more recent literature focuses on how it can be done within the sciences.

        Queering now is used to de-normalize what is often normal, or to examine closely what makes a subject morally wrong, as opposed to its opposition; so as to discover, or reveal, what was hidden but obfuscated.

    ## Informatics of Domination

    The <span style="text-decoration: underline">informatics of domination</span> is a term to represent the "white capitalist imperialist patriarchy in its contemporary late versions" (Haraway, 2006).

    <aside class="notes">
      Donna Haraway famously in her body of work interrogates the natural vs artifical, through the construction of each she places an emphasis on the science that has manifested this binary and argues that is done through cybernetics. This system of power structures is one she deems to be the "informatics of domination".

      Nevertheless, she fails to recognize the importance of abled-bodiedness and heteronormative standards that also have come to shape society, so I've made up my own version of this for the rest of the presentation.

      <h2>1. Code as Race</h2>
      <aside class="notes">
        I'll begin with code in race.

        Queer theory and critical race theory share familiar aspects in the realm of resistance. However, within STS it's easy to get by without mentioning race, in spite of our efforts toward an intersectional lens.

        Nevertheless, I think it's important to consider how the basis of most technologies is constructed and outsourced at the low-paid or unpaid labour of people of colour.

        <li>Between 1965 and 1975, 922 Navajo women were employed to work on circuit assembly in Shiprock, New Mexico (Nakamura, 2014)</li>
        <li class="fragment">"Indian" women "have" an affinity toward textiles and craft</li>
        <li class="fragment">Narrative obscures competitive capitalistic heart</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        This story is constructed to justify this labour: propsensity to making intricate designs of circuitry due to cultural practices like beadwork. Navajo women were retroactively observed to have deft, nimble fingers, which has since been adopted to describe south and south east asian women labourers.

        This narrative alludes to a personal connnection to the product, binding workers to their production by the notion of inherent talent; alhough the work remains to be procedural labour.

        The uplifting narrative obscures the low pay, working conditions, and inital reasonings for hiring on Navajo land: low taxation. At its heart, a capitalistic venture.

        In technology, another way in which obscuring happens is through modularity.

      <h2>UNIX principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">"Modularity"; abstracts and obscures away complexity</li>
        <li class="fragment">"Separation of Concerns"; each module is used for one thing only</li>
        <li class="fragment">Reflects the identity politics which fractured solidarity between unionizing labour workers and black and POC activists (McPherson, 2012)</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        During that same time period Bell Labs was conceiving of a set of rules that would be dogmatically followed by most programmers decades later, and to the present day. Those are the UNIX principles.

        UNIX is an open source operating system that has now become the basis for most computers today. There are many principles, but today we will focus on just one: modularity and separation of concerns.

        These two principles abstracts away much of the complexity of code, while separating and categorizing the intent of the snippets of code. McPherson also notices he development of this logic also occurs simultaneously when idenity politics began to overtake class consciousness: labour union workers and civil rights activists were working together, but slowly became divisive.

      <p>"We have to shake ourselves out of our small, field-based boxes so that we might take seriously the possibility that our own knowledge practices are normalized, modular, and black boxed in much the same way as the code we study in our work." (McPherson, 2012)</p>
      <aside class="notes">
        It is impossible to say that the logic of UNIX has become reflected in our actions and thoughts -- or merely it's a manifestation of its ethos.

        But McPherson urges us to consider the tools we use and the logic that is embedded within their construction, materiality, as another entry-point for self-reflexivity.

        Belief in a moral liberal ideology / libertarian fantasy; minimizes gender differences
       </li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="notes">
        MCCs are a way to sociologically describe the culture which prioritizes hegemonic masculinity and masculine traits to be expressed in order to succeed in a social group.
        - Rape jokes, aggressive comments and lack of support to new-comers to code.
        - Often women are deferred to do "softer" work such as writing documentation, rather than writing code. Mentorship for women were often seen as a dating opportunity or free emotional labour.
        What is observed to happen in open-source communities, is believed to be a part of hte larger ideologies of tech communities, which is a belief in moreal liberal ideologies; one which is post-gender.

      <h2>Haraway's Cybernetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Communication = Control</li>
        <li class="fragment">Obscures the relations of domination</li>
        <li class="fragment">"Obscures the competitive bedrock of captialism with with phenomena like altruism and liberal corporate responsbility" (Haraway, 1991)</li>
        <li class="fragment">Software systems is a "soft control" (Gaboury, 2018)</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        Haraway argues that cybernetics is akin to control. It obscures the controlling forces that render us powerless; sometimes by obscuring the relationships we have to our product, or by covering it up with liberal idealogies.

        We often speak of intersectionality in the context of those who are oppressed. But Haraway urges us also to consider how intersectionality exists also in those who are oppressors.

        For Haraway, the informatics of domination is a part of the technology within cybernetics which controls and obscures. How software contributes to that is an important dialogue, and Gaboury argues, in the Foucaldian sense, is a enactment of a "soft control",

        When we reveal these aspects of code through the lens of queerness we are offered a way to realize our position in relation with the technology and what power structures they bind us to.

    <h2>Glissant's Right to Opacity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Obscurity =/= Opacity</li>
      <li class="fragment">"Understanding" people is premised on transparency which requires an ideal measurements; reductive</li>
      <li class="fragment">Opacity = "an irreducible singularity" (Glissant, 1997)</li>
      <li class="fragment">"[T]he idea of totality alone is an obstacle to totality." (Glissant, 1997)</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
      When we encounter obscurity, it is not the same as opacity.

      Thus far we have agreed to the theory of differences; accepting differences has been important to the recognition of minorities, but is premised on understanding which inevitably breaks a subject down, and recontructs them within my own finite worldview and measurement.

      Glissant then, insists on Opacity, which is coming to see and hold everything for what it is, without reduction; "an irreducible singularity".

      How can we begin to understand when we are using scales and measures in order to extract and categorize each horror? each triumph? each human body?

      Glissant brings this up in the context of the trans-atlantic slave trade, when each human body was measured by their strength, child for their potential and sold for a calculated cost.

      For Glissant, the philosophy of opacity, is not to understand what to measure, but to bare witness to the relations of the whole.

      <p>"Only by understanding that it is impossible to reduce anyone, no matter who, to a truth [they] would not have generated on [their] own. That is, within the opacity of [their] time and place. [...]This same opacity is also the force that drives every community." (Glissant, 1997)</p>
      <aside class="notes">
        Glissant's right to opacity is then a consciousness that weaves darkness with lightness. It accepts all that we cannot accept and understand, and in a queer context, allows one to refuse to be defined and categorized. To some scholars, this opacity is a place of resistance, and must be preserved inside our technical systems.

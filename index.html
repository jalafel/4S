    ## Informatics of Domination

    "Informatics of domination" acts as a representation of the "white capitalist imperialist patriarchy in its contemporary late versions" (Haraway, 2006).

    I argue that Haraway's informatics of domination gives us a lens to queer how code propagates power structures in society.

      ## Code as Military (and Therefore Masculine)

      - origins of code in military
      - WW2 with cryptography and queer scientists (most famously Alan Turing)
      - code read in analysis' as masculine because of militant history
      - Wacjman rereads technology as being domestic
      - King analyzes cryptopgraphy at the time in conflation with queerness and queer codes

      ## Code as Masculinity Culture Contests (MCCs)

      - MCCs observed in open source communities
      - how open is open source if only 1.5% of participants are women ?
      - history of Linux and Unix
      - open source gets co-opted by large companies as a means to appeal to the larger developmental communities and free labour
      - these large companies are stakeholders in considerations of open-source decisions
      - black-box of Netflix that Firefox had to adopt to compete

      ## Code as Behaviours

      - algorithms take in interactions through social media sites in order to coalesce data and habits to sell to advertisers
      - famous case of flyers being sent out to pregnant women before they even knew they were pregnant
      - hidden violence of reifying gender

      ## Code as Race - Wendy Chen

      - digital media are made by women of colour
      - 922 Navajo women were employed to work on circuit assembly between 1965 and 1975
      in New Mexico, Shiprock
      - found to be excellent at this work and a narrative was built around it, since Indian women had an affinity toward textiles and craft and a discourse was borne, nimble fingers
      - shows how racialization is a process and not a product

      ## Cybernetics as Haraway articulates it

      - Communication = control

      - "obscuring the relations of domination in production"

      - "obscures the competitive bedrock of captialism w phenomena like altruism and liberal corporate responsbility in transnational enterprises"

      - example: Darwin's competitive biological paradigm has been adopted by our algorithms and computer systems
      - example from all previous slides (remind audience)

      ## Gliassant's Right to Opacity
      - “Human behaviours are fractal in nature”
      - Transparency =/= opacity
      - Understanding is premised on transparency which requires scales and measurements and lead to reduction

      ## Discussion & Conclusion

      - From Haraway, the system of domination appears at once both infinite and immovable, and fragile, brittle, and could collapse at any second.

      - This paradox is the nature of domination for it's not static, in fact it could

      - By revealing these aspects of code through the lens of queerness we are offered a way to challenge te existing structures, or at least how we understand more fully how we exist within relation with the technology we use everyday

<!--       - Baudrillard writes, theorists must imagine another political economic based on more than just the human capacity to produce: they must “find a realm beyond economic value.”

      - Glissant writes that opacity is about responsibility for healing the entire rhizome (Deleuzian) -->

      ## What questions arise once we examine these
      - Are networks/Deluezian rhizomes a sustainable paradigm to continue forward?
      - (Alternatives: fractalization, recursion)

        a tool to examine binaries, started off with homosexuality/heterosexuality

        often it is a tool to interogate binaries which dominates another, or is supposedly better than the other? deviancy at the heart of the binary, or something within the margins

        high-brow/low-brow media culture

        natural/artifical
        past/future
        monogamy/non-monogamy
        white/non-white

        language, too!

        IoD overlays our society. It's a part of it. How then, can we parse and name what is a
        dominating structure? How can we understand te network that Haraway names as both fragile and overbeaing at once?

    ## Informatics of Domination

    The <span style="text-decoration: underline">informatics of domination</span> is a term to represent the "white capitalist imperialist patriarchy in its contemporary late versions" (Haraway, 2006).

    <aside class="notes">
      Donna Haraway famously in her body of work interrogates the natural vs artifical, conflating and comingingling the two into a satirical non-entity that rises above the socialist politic parties at the time, to become a cyborgian goddess

      Nevertheless, she fails to recognize the importance of abled-bodiedness and heteronormative standards that also have come to shape society, so i've made a quick addition to her framework to continue on for this presentation

      <h2>1. Code as Race</h2>
      <aside class="notes">
        It's difficult to speak about queer theory within referring to critical race theory. Within STS it's easy to get by without mentioning race outside of facial recognition problems.
        Nevertheless we must consider how the basis of most technologies is constructed and outsourced at the low-paid or unpaid labour of people of colour.

        <li class="fragment">Narrative obscures competitive capitalistic heart</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        Story is constructed to justify this labour: an inherent talent, propsensity due to craft/beadwork and deft, nimble fingers of women of colour. This alludes to some art or talent to craft, thought the work remains to be Marxist and procedural in construction. The uplifting narrative obscures the low pay, working conditions, and inital reasonings for hiring on Navajo land: low taxation. At its heart, a capitalistic venture.

        Another way obscuring happens is through modularity.

      <h2>UNIX principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">"Modularity"; abstracts and obscures away complexity</li>
        <li class="fragment">"Separation of Concerns"; each module is used for one thing only</li>
        <li class="fragment">Reflects the identity politics which fractured solidarity between unionizing labour workers and black and POC activists</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        At the same time, during those years Bell Labs was conceiving of a set of rules that would be dogmatically followed by most programmers decades later, and to the present day. Those are the UNIX principles.

        UNIX is an open source program that has now become the basis for most operating systems today. (Including tablets, smartphones, and CPUs).

        There are many principles, but today we will focus on just one: modularity and separation of concerns.

        Through these two principles which abstracts away much of the complexity of code. The development of this logic also corresponds to a time in which idenity politics began to overtake class consciousness: labour union workers and civil rights activists were working together, but slowly became divisive.

        It is impossible to say that the logic of UNIX has become reflected in our actions and thoughts -- or merely it's a manifestation of its ethos.

        Nevertheless, let us consider the tools we use and the logic that is embedded within their construction and ultimately materiality.

      </li>
       <li class="fragment">Firefox =/= 100% "open"</li>
     </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        - MCCs are a way to sociologically describe the culture which prioritizes hegemonic masculinity and masculine traits to be expressed in order to succeed in a social group.
        - Rape jokes, aggressive comments and lack of support to new-comers to code.
        - Often women are deferred to do "softer" work such as writing documentation, rather than writing code. Mentorship for women were often seen as a dating opportunity or free emotional labour.
        - Open-source co-opted by large companies; who behave as stakeholders in considerations of open-source decisions.
        - Black-box of Netflix that Firefox had to adopt to compete.

        <li class="fragment">Communication = control</li>
        <li class="fragment">"obscuring the relations of domination in production"</li>
        <li class="fragment">"obscures the competitive bedrock of captialism w phenomena like altruism and liberal corporate responsbility in transnational enterprises"</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        We often speak of intersectionality in the context of those who are oppressed. But Haraway urges us also to consider how intersectionality exists also in those who are oppressors.

        For Haraway, the informatics of domination is a part of the technology within cybernetics which controls and obscures.

        By revealing these aspects of code through the lens of queerness we are offered a way to realize our position within relation with the technology we use everyday.

      <h2>Glissant's Right to Opacity</h2>

      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Transparency =/= opacity</li>
        <li class="fragment">"Understanding" is premised on transparency which requires scales and measurements andlead to reduction</li>
        <li class="fragment">"Human behaviours are fractal in nature"</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="notes">
        Opacity is coming to see and hold everything for what it is, without reduction.

        how can we begin to understand when we are using scales and measures in order to extract and categorize each horror? each triumph? each human body? poignant how glissant begins on the stories of the boat slave

        Glissant brings this up in the context of the trans-atlantic slave trade, when each human body was measured by their strength, child for their potential and sold for a calculated cost.

        For Glissant, the philosophy of opacity, is not to understand, but to bare witness to the relations; and what those relationships reveal.

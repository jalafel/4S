      a tool to examine binaries, started off with homosexuality/heterosexuality

      often it is a tool to interogate binaries which dominates another, or is supposedly better than the other? deviancy at the heart of the binary, or something within the margins

      IoD overlays our society. It's a part of it. How then, can we parse and name what is a
      dominating structure? How can we understand te network that Haraway names as both fragile and overbeaing at once?

    ## Informatics of Domination

    The <span style="text-decoration: underline">informatics of domination</span> is a term to represent the "white capitalist imperialist patriarchy in its contemporary late versions" (Haraway, 2006).

    <aside class="notes">
      Donna Haraway famously in her body of work interrogates the natural vs artifical, conflating and comingingling the two into a satirical non-entity that rises above the socialist politic parties at the time, to become a cyborgian goddess

      Nevertheless, she fails to recognize the importance of abled-bodiedness and heteronormative standards that also have come to shape society, so i've made a quick addition to her framework to continue on for this presentation

            Thesis: Here, I've collected an assemblage of theorists and scholars who have
      focused on aspects on how code is part and parcel in the informatics of domination.

      Haraway's informatics of domination gives us a lens to queer how code propagates power structures in society.

      <h2>Code as Race</h2>
      Chen & MacPherson
      <aside class="notes">
        It's difficult to speak about queer theory within referring to critical race theory (gaboury here).

        And likewise within STS it's quite easy to get by without mentioning race outside of facial recognition problems.

        Nevertheless we must consider how the basis of most technologies is constructed and outsourced at the low-paid or unpaid labour of people of colour. Present & Past.

      <aside class="notes">
        Story is constructed to justify this labour: an inherent talent, propsensity due to craft/beadwork and deft, nimble fingers of women of colour. This alludes to some art or talent to craft, thought the work remains to be Marxist and procedural in construction. The uplifting narrative obscures the low pay, working conditions, and inital reasonings for hiring on Navajo land: low taxation. At it's heart, a capitalistic venture.

      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">

        At the same time, during those years Bell Labs was conceiving of a set of rules that would be dogmatically followed by most programmers decades later, and to the present day. Those are the UNIX principles.

        UNIX is an open source program that has now become the basis for most operating systems today. (Including tablets, smartphones, and cpus). There are 12 principles, but today we will focus on just one:

        Modularity and single-purpose

        UNIX principle of : modularity and single use has abstracted away much code
        the development of this logic also corresponds to a time in which idenity politics began to overtake class consciousness: labour union workers and civil rights activists were working together, but slowly became divisive. disciplines in the academy also became separated. it is impossible to say that the logic of UNIX has become reflected in our actions and thoughts due to its wide distribution -- or merely it's a manifestation, like many other inventions, music, art, sciences, of the ethos of the time. nevertheless, i want to point one to consider the tools we make and use and how they are derived. the logic that is embedded within them. whether or not its materiality and construction affect us.

      diagram and explanation of game

      one must __perform__ gender in order to trick and to win. this game, and ultimately theoretical goal that intelligence may be manufactured is premised on the exhibition that gender may also be performed (tricked?). nevertheless, it is never directly associated ot those who reject that gender might be, as butler asserts, totally and utterly fake and made through practice.

      this remains to be a problem with a liberal notion within coding communities, a belief in post-genderism

      <h2>Haraway's Cybernetics</h2>

      <ul>

      <li>Communication = control</li>
      <li>"obscuring the relations of domination in production"</li>
      <li>"obscures the competitive bedrock of captialism w phenomena like altruism and liberal corporate responsbility in transnational enterprises"</li>
      </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      We often speak of intersectionality in the context of those who are oppressed. But Haraway urges us also to consider how intersectionality exists also in those who are oppressors.

      - From Haraway, the system of domination appears at once both infinite and immovable, and fragile, brittle, and could collapse at any second.

      - This paradox is the nature of domination for it's not static, in fact it could

      - By revealing these aspects of code through the lens of queerness we are offered a way to challenge te existing structures, or at least how we understand more fully how we exist within relation with the technology we use everyday

      - Baudrillard writes, theorists must imagine another political economic based on more than just the human capacity to produce: they must “find a realm beyond economic value.”

      - Glissant writes that opacity is about responsibility for healing the entire rhizome (Deleuzian)

      - example: Darwin's competitive biological paradigm has been adopted by our algorithms and computer systems
      - example from all previous slides (remind audience)

    <h2>Glissant's Right to Opacity</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Transparency =/= opacity</li>
      <li>"Understanding" is premised on transparency which requires scales and measurements andlead to reduction</li>
      <li>“Human behaviours are fractal in nature”</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
      Opacity is coming to see and hold everything for what it is, without reduction.

      how can we begin to understand when we are using scales and measures in order to extract and categorize each horror? each triumph? each human body? poignant how glissant begins on the stories of the boat slave

      Glissant brings this up in the context of the trans-atlantic slave trade and his origin and connection to the caribbean,

       ... when each human body was measured by their strength, child for their potential and sold for a calculated cost.

      For Glissant, the philosophy of opacity, is not to understand, but to bare witness to the relations; and what those relationships reveal.

      <!-- And that is the reason in which I spoke today, in order to further reveal and understand by placing side by side these case studies another strand of entangled-ment we exist, without trying to understand, reduce, or redact. -->
